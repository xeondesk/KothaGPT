# Preference / Alignment — Implementation Plan

Goal: take the instruction-tuned KothaGPT checkpoints (`ml/sft/artifacts/`) and
align them to human preference — reward model, DPO, and a release-grade
evaluation battery covering preference, hallucination, safety, helpfulness,
Bengali quality, and refusal behavior.

Guiding principles:

- Build on what exists: `ml/sft/` provides the chat template, assistant-mask
  dataset tooling, and tuned checkpoints; `ml/trainer/` provides the loop,
  checkpoint, scheduler, and monitoring. Alignment layers *preference* on top:
  pair/rejection sampling, a reward model head, DPO objective, and safety/refusal
  gates.
- Human data is precious and expensive: start with seed preference pairs from
  synthetic/rule-based judges, verify them, then hand-label a small high-quality
  set. Every record carries `{source, annotator, verified}`.
- Safety is a release gate, not an afterthought: alignment runs cannot ship
  until the safety/refusal evals (WS-6/WS-9) pass.
- Every run is reproducible: pinned to (SFT checkpoint, preference data version,
  reward model, DPO config) and recorded in `ml/preference/artifacts/<run-id>/`.
- PyTorch stays a training-only dependency; never import `torch` from the API
  service.

## Current state (map of what exists)

| Area | Exists | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SFT checkpoints | `ml/sft/` plan (`docs/sft-plan.md`); chat template + masked-loss tooling specified | SFT not yet run; no aligned-release base |
| Preference package | `ml/preference/` exists but is empty | whole workstream missing |
| Trainer core | `ml/trainer/` loop, checkpoint (atomic/resume), scheduler, monitor, DDP/FSDP, mixed precision | only causal-LM + SFT loss paths; no reward / DPO objectives |
| Data pipeline | `data/pipeline/` gates + `data/pipeline/schema.py` (role/content) per SFT plan | no preference pair schema, no judge/annotator tooling |
| Eval | `evals/run.py` + `evals/suites/` (bangla v1, sft* planned) | no preference/safety/hallucination/refusal suites |
| Configs | `ml/configs/small.yaml`, planned `sft*.yaml` | no reward/dpo configs |

## Workstreams

### WS-1 — Human preference dataset তৈরি (`data/pipeline/preference.py`)

Goal: a versioned, pair-structured preference corpus (chosen vs rejected).

- Define the preference schema in `data/pipeline/preference.py`:
  `{prompt, chosen, rejected, source, annotator, task_type, quality_score}`;
  validate with the same pydantic-style gate as `schema.py`.
- Seed with **synthetic/rule-based preference pairs**: sample two SFT responses
  per prompt and rank them with a rule-based judge (length/verbosity, format
  compliance, key-fact overlap); keep only high-agreement pairs.
- Hand-label a small high-quality Bangla + English set (target ≥ 1–2k pairs)
  with inter-annotator agreement recorded; keep a held-out preference eval set
  never used in training.
- Run through Phase-B gates (toxic/PII/copyright) and B6 scoring; land shards at
  `data/processed/<ver>/preference/` with train/validation/test splits.
- Deliverables: `preference.py`, synthetic judge, hand-label manifest, shards +
  `MANIFEST.json`.
- Metric: synthetic-judge agreement with hand labels ≥ threshold; zero PII/license
  failures; held-out eval set never leaks into train (hash-checked).

### WS-2 — Reward model তৈরি (`ml/preference/reward.py`)

Goal: a scalar reward head over the frozen SFT base to score responses.

- Add a reward model head on `KothaGPT` (SFT checkpoints frozen, learn a linear
  head + optionally a final MLP over the last-token hidden state).
- Train on WS-1 pairs with a pairwise ranking loss; reuse `ml/trainer/` loop;
  record `rm.jsonl` (pairwise accuracy, rank correlation) in the run dir.
- Serve for **rejection sampling** (best-of-N response selection) — the DPO
  reference data source in WS-3.
- Deliverables: `ml/preference/reward.py`, `ml/configs/reward.yaml`, RM
  artifacts.
- Metric: held-out pairwise accuracy ≥ threshold (e.g. ≥ 70%); RM scores are
  calibrated (ties broken consistently); best-of-N beats SFT on eval.

### WS-3 — DPO pipeline তৈরি (`ml/preference/dpo.py`)

Goal: preference-tune the SFT model with Direct Preference Optimization.

- Implement the DPO loss (reference log-probs from the frozen SFT checkpoint,
  β temperature, label smoothing option) as a new trainer objective; keep the
  chat template + assistant-mask semantics from SFT.
- Generate the DPO reference data via RM-guided rejection sampling (WS-2): for
  each prompt, keep chosen = best-of-N, rejected = a mid-ranked sample.
- Reuse `ml/trainer/` loop/checkpoint/resume; `ml/configs/dpo.yaml` (β, batch,
  LR ~1e-6..5e-6, epochs, mix of preference + SFT data to prevent collapse).
- Deliverables: `ml/preference/dpo.py`, `ml/configs/dpo.yaml`, DPO artifacts.
- Metric: a CPU smoke run completes; preference eval (WS-4) improves vs SFT
  while SFT benchmarks stay non-worse; loss does not collapse to degenerate
  distributions.

### WS-4 — Preference evaluation (`evals/suites/preference.yaml`)

Goal: measure whether alignment actually follows preference.

- Extend `evals/run.py` with a preference/chat mode: for each eval prompt,
  sample N responses from the aligned model; score with the RM (held-out RM,
  not the one used for DPO sampling) + pairwise win-rate vs the SFT baseline.
- Emit win-rate tables per task family (general, reasoning, coding,
  conversation, function-call, tool-use).
- Deliverables: `evals/suites/preference.yaml`, win-rate + RM-score report.
- Metric: aligned model wins ≥ threshold% of pairs vs SFT; per-family win-rates
  reported and no family regresses below base.

### WS-5 — Hallucination evaluation (`evals/suites/hallucination.yaml`)

Goal: quantify groundedness so alignment improves factuality, not fluency.

- Build a hallucination suite: extraction/QA prompts with gold contexts
  (Bangla + English), factual-consistency prompts, and open-ended probes.
- Score with NLI-style consistency (entailment of answer in context) plus
  keyword/entity-overlap baselines; report hallucination rate per family.
- Deliverables: hallucination suite + metric in `evals/metrics.py`.
- Metric: hallucination rate ≤ threshold on the suite; no worse than SFT base;
  entity/date/fact spot-checks pass.

### WS-6 — Safety evaluation (`evals/suites/safety.yaml`)

Goal: a deterministic safety gate for release.

- Curate safety prompts (toxic, PII-leak, harmful-instruction, self-harm,
  hate/profanity in Bangla + English) reusing `data/pipeline/toxic.py`
  blocklists as baselines.
- Score refusal + non-toxicity: model must refuse harmful requests (see WS-9)
  and must not emit blocked content on benign prompts.
- Deliverables: safety suite + pass/fail report.
- Metric: 100% (or ≥ documented threshold) refusal on harmful prompts; zero
  toxic output on benign prompts; PII-leak rate zero.

### WS-7 — Helpfulness evaluation (`evals/suites/helpfulness.yaml`)

Goal: alignment must not trade safety for uselessness.

- Prompt sets where a helpful answer is expected (benign questions, partial
  info, "I don't know" cases): score answerability, information sufficiency,
  verbosity fit, and non-refusal.
- Use a mix of reference-based (BLEU/ROUGE on gold answers where available) and
  reference-free (RM score, length-fit) signals.
- Deliverables: helpfulness suite + report.
- Metric: helpfulness score ≥ threshold; refusal-on-benign rate ≤ threshold;
  no over-verbosity regression vs SFT.

### WS-8 — Bengali quality evaluation (`evals/suites/bangla-quality.yaml`)

Goal: guarantee alignment improves — never damages — Bangla language quality.

- Extend the Bangla v1 benchmarks (QA/translation/summarization/generation) with
  a language-quality lens: grammaticality, transliteration fidelity (via
  `ml/tokenizer/transliterate.py`), token efficiency, and register fit.
- Report aligned vs SFT vs base comparisons per metric.
- Deliverables: `evals/suites/bangla-quality.yaml` + report.
- Metric: Bengali quality metrics ≥ SFT base and ≥ documented thresholds;
  tokenizer unk rate and decode fidelity stay at 0%/100%.

### WS-9 — Refusal behavior evaluation (`evals/suites/refusal.yaml`)

Goal: calibrated refusal — refuse the harmful, answer the safe.

- Three-way classification of every model response to safety/benign/edge
  prompts: `answer | refuse | partial`. Tune refusal wording to be calm,
  specific, and Bangla-first.
- Report confusion-style table: false refusals (benign → refuse) must stay
  below threshold; true refusals (harmful → refuse) above threshold.
- Deliverables: refusal suite + classifier + report.
- Metric: true-refusal rate ≥ threshold on harmful, false-refusal rate ≤
  threshold on benign; refusal tone consistent across Bangla/English.

## Sequencing & dependencies

```text
WS-1 preference dataset ──> WS-2 reward model ──> WS-3 DPO (needs RM sampling)
                               │                        │
WS-6 safety eval ── WS-9 refusal eval ──────────────────┤  (release gates)
WS-5 hallucination ── WS-7 helpfulness ── WS-8 bangla quality ─┐
WS-4 preference eval ─────────────────────────────────────────┤
                                └──> release gate: all suites green
```

WS-1 → WS-2 → WS-3 is the critical path (dataset → reward → DPO). WS-5..WS-9
eval suites build in parallel and are the release gate for WS-2/WS-3 artifacts.
WS-4 is the primary measure of alignment quality; WS-6/WS-9 are hard gates
(no ship while harmful prompts are answered or benign prompts are refused).

```

Never commit model weights or preference shards; `ml/preference/artifacts/` and
`data/processed/<ver>/preference/` are git-ignored. Alignment builds directly on
`docs/sft-plan.md` checkpoints; preference tuning is upstream of the safety
release checklist.
